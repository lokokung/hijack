# Hijack - a social mobile game
Hijack is a web app game meant to be played on mobile devices with friends. Similar to [Spyfall](https://github.com/evanbrumley/spyfall), players enter one room to start. Also, much of the base of this project is based on mentioned repo, so see the link for instructions on how to run the game yourself.

The details on gameplay are posted below the buttons on the homepage. Tools and technologies used for this project include Meteor.js, Handlebars.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

# Disclaimer
This game was made in 24 hours at a hackathon. Hence, it gets a bit hacky toward the end (but it works).
